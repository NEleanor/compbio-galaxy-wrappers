description: STAR Fusion detects fusion genes in RNA-Seq data after running RNA-STAR
long_description: |
   STAR-Fusion further processes the output generated by the STAR aligner to
   map junction reads and spanning reads to a reference annotation set (using a
   GTF file, ideally the same annotation file used during the STAR genome index
   building process during the intial STAR setup).
