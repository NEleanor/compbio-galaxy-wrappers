                         [-x {m,y,male,Male,f,x,female,Female}]
                         [--no-shift-xy] [-o FILENAME]
                         filenames [filenames ...]

positional arguments:
  filenames             Sample coverages as raw probes (.cnr) or segments
                        (.cns).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b, --by-bin          Plot data x-coordinates by bin indices instead of
                        genomic coordinates. All bins will be shown with equal
                        width, no blank regions will be shown, and x-axis
                        values indicate bin number (within chromosome) instead
                        of genomic position.
  -c CHROMOSOME, --chromosome CHROMOSOME
                        Chromosome (e.g. 'chr1') or chromosomal range (e.g.
                        'chr1:2333000-2444000') to display. If a range is
                        given, all targeted genes in this range will be shown,
                        unless '--gene'/'-g' is already given.
  -d, --desaturate      Tweak color saturation to focus on significant
                        changes.
  -y, --male-reference, --haploid-x-reference
                        Assume inputs were normalized to a male reference
                        (i.e. female samples will have +1 log-CNR of chrX;
                        otherwise male samples would have -1 chrX).
  -x {m,y,male,Male,f,x,female,Female}, --sample-sex {m,y,male,Male,f,x,female,Female}, -g {m,y,male,Male,f,x,female,Female}, --gender {m,y,male,Male,f,x,female,Female}
                        Specify the chromosomal sex of all given samples as
                        male or female. (Default: guess each sample from
                        coverage of X and Y chromosomes).
  --no-shift-xy         Don't adjust the X and Y chromosomes according to
                        sample sex.
  -o FILENAME, --output FILENAME
                        Output PDF file name.
