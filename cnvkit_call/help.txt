positional arguments:
  filename              Copy ratios (.cnr or .cns).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --center [{mean,median,mode,biweight}]
                        Re-center the log2 ratio values using this estimator
                        of the center or average value. ('median' if no
                        argument given.)
  --center-at CENTER_AT
                        Subtract a constant number from all log2 values. For
                        "manual" re-centering, in case the --center option
                        gives unsatisfactory results.)
  --filter {ampdel,cn,ci,sem}
                        Merge segments flagged by the specified filter(s) with
                        the adjacent segment(s).
  -m {threshold,clonal,none}, --method {threshold,clonal,none}
                        Calling method. [Default: threshold]
  -t THRESHOLDS, --thresholds THRESHOLDS
                        Hard thresholds for calling each integer copy number,
                        separated by commas. Use the '=' sign on the command
                        line, e.g.: -t=-1,0,1 [Default: -1.1,-0.25,0.2,0.7]
  --ploidy PLOIDY       Ploidy of the sample cells. [Default: 2]
  --purity PURITY       Estimated tumor cell fraction, a.k.a. purity or
                        cellularity.
  --drop-low-coverage   Drop very-low-coverage bins before segmentation to
                        avoid false-positive deletions in poor-quality tumor
                        samples.
  -x {m,y,male,Male,f,x,female,Female}, --sample-sex {m,y,male,Male,f,x,female,Female}, -g {m,y,male,Male,f,x,female,Female}, --gender {m,y,male,Male,f,x,female,Female}
                        Specify the sample's chromosomal sex as male or
                        female. (Otherwise guessed from X and Y coverage).
  -y, --male-reference, --haploid-x-reference
                        Was a male reference used? If so, expect half ploidy
                        on chrX and chrY; otherwise, only chrY has half
                        ploidy. In CNVkit, if a male reference was used, the
                        "neutral" copy number (ploidy) of chrX is 1; chrY is
                        haploid for either reference sex.
  -o FILENAME, --output FILENAME
                        Output table file name (CNR-like table of segments,
                        .cns).

To additionally process SNP b-allele frequencies for allelic copy number:
  -v FILENAME, --vcf FILENAME
                        VCF file name containing variants for calculation of
                        b-allele frequencies.
  -i SAMPLE_ID, --sample-id SAMPLE_ID
                        Name of the sample in the VCF (-v/--vcf) to use for
                        b-allele frequency extraction.
  -n NORMAL_ID, --normal-id NORMAL_ID
                        Corresponding normal sample ID in the input VCF
                        (-v/--vcf). This sample is used to select only
                        germline SNVs to calculate b-allele frequencies.
  --min-variant-depth MIN_VARIANT_DEPTH
                        Minimum read depth for a SNV to be used in the
                        b-allele frequency calculation. [Default: 20]
  -z [ALT_FREQ], --zygosity-freq [ALT_FREQ]
                        Ignore VCF's genotypes (GT field) and instead infer
                        zygosity from allele frequencies. [Default if used
                        without a number: 0.25]
